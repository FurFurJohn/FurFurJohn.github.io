It is simple to use, but it is also the foundation of some of the more advanced regression methods. So you may ask: what is ordinary least squares? What is a regression? And why am I learning this? What am I gonna use it for? Just bear with me, and I will provide examples of why regressions are very useful in today’s world. And keep in mind, because this blog is just an elementary introduction for ordinary least squares, so I will not dive into the difficult math equations to prove its assumptions and merits. Nor will I go over specific codes to calculate it. It is beyond the scope of this blog. "

Of course not! They know that because there is a relationship between a person’s height and foot size.

Just like people are connected with different relationships, variables can also be connected with certain relationships. Regression analysis helps us discover these relationships. It identifies one variable as a dependent variable, and other one or more variables as independent variables. Then it studies how the change of independent variables will affect the dependent variable. The relationships between dependent variables and independent variables help us better understand the world. Ordinary least squares (or OLS in short) is a way to discover this kind of relationship."
