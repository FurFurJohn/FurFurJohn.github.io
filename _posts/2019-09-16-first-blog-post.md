title: First Blog Post!
---

This is my first blog post. It is my lab assignment for DSCI 521 Programming Platforms. I followed the instructions from https://github.com/ttimbers/lesson-github-pages/blob/master/lesson/lesson.md
It was hard at first to follow the instructions, but later things get better. 

I am a Master of Data Science student at UBC. This is my first year. I am really excited about the new program. I will learn a lot and become a data scientist in the future.
